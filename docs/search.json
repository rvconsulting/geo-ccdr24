It is part of a larger project with all background contributions to Georgia’s CCDR, available in this repository.\nUsing RStudio project makes it possible to not use setwd() to establish the root directory and refer to subdirectories in a relative manner, making interoperability easier within teams and not hard coding a particular computer’s file structure into the code. If you are using Positron or Visual Studio Code (and the Quarto extension) just “open folder” at the root of the repository. If you are using R directly, just add setwd(r'(C:\\My\\path\\to\\project\\root)') at the beginning of your coding session.\n\n\nWe start with a clean environment, making sure that any objects from a previous session are not present.

    "text": "5.1 Aggregation of population data\nThis is based on a custom command to reweight the survey according to macroeconomic data for every possible combination of variant, year, and country. In the macro data we know they only used the “medium” variant and we only need to reweight for two specific years for Georgia (GEO), so we will conduct the reweighting directly with these parameters.\nWe join several cohorts from 0 to 29 years old and from 60 onwards, because the reweighting procedure works best if each category is at least 5% of the population. The solution here works best for Georgia.\n\npopulation_projections &lt;- population_projections |&gt;\n  # filter(Variant == \"Medium\") |&gt;\n  # Recoding cohorts into ordered factors\n    mutate(\n      cohort_short = factor(\n        case_when(\n          cohort %in% \n            c(\"P0004\", \"P0509\",\"P1014\",\n              \"P1519\",\"P2024\", \"P2529\") ~ \"P0029\",\n          cohort %in% \n            c(\"P3034\", \"P3539\") ~ \"P3039\",\n          cohort %in% \n            c(\"P4044\", \"P4549\") ~ \"P4049\",\n          cohort %in% \n            c(\"P5054\", \"P5559\") ~ \"P5059\",\n          cohort %in% \n            c(\"P6064\", \"P6569\",\"P7074\", \"P7579\",\n              \"P8084\", \"P8589\", \"P9094\", \"P9599\",\n              \"P100up\") ~ \"P60up\"), \n        levels = \n          c(\"P0029\", \"P3039\", \"P4049\",\n            \"P5059\", \"P60up\"))) |&gt;\n  # Get also factor 'cohort' to numeric codes\n  mutate(cohort_code = as.integer(cohort_short))\n\nLet’s now create cohorts in our pp_microsim data to match our population projection data.\n\n# Convert 'age' into 'cohort' factor with levels ordered as specified\npp_microsim10 &lt;- pp_microsim09 |&gt;\n    mutate(cohort = factor(case_when(\n    age &gt;= 0  & age &lt;= 29 ~ \"P0029\",\n    age &gt;= 30 & age &lt;= 39 ~ \"P3039\",\n    age &gt;= 40 & age &lt;= 49 ~ \"P4049\",\n    age &gt;= 50 & age &lt;= 59 ~ \"P5059\",\n    age &gt;= 60  ~ \"P60up\"\n  ), levels = c(\"P0029\", \"P3039\", \"P4049\", \"P5059\", \"P60up\")))\n\n# Convert the 'cohort' and 'gender' factor to numeric codes\npp_microsim11 &lt;- pp_microsim10  |&gt; \n  mutate(cohort_code = as.integer(cohort))  |&gt;  \n  mutate(gender_code = as.integer(gender)) |&gt; \n  mutate(weight = Weights / 4)\n\n# rm(list = ls(pattern = \"^pp_microsim[0-9]+$\"))\n\nWe also need demographic targets for 2030 and 2050\n\n# Ensure pop_targets_2030 is correctly prepared\n# We use the \"Medium\" variant = variants[7]\npop_targets_2030 &lt;- population_projections  |&gt; \n  filter(year == 2030, Variant == variants[7])  |&gt; \n  group_by(cohort_code, cohort_short) |&gt; \n    summarize(female = sum(yf),\n              male   = sum(ym), \n              total = sum(total_population),\n              ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\npop_targets_2050 &lt;- population_projections  |&gt; \n  filter(year == 2050, Variant == variants[7])  |&gt; \n  group_by(cohort_code, cohort_short) |&gt; \n    summarize(female = sum(yf),\n              male   = sum(ym), \n              total = sum(total_population),\n              ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\npop_total_2030 &lt;- sum(pop_targets_2030$total)\npop_total_2050 &lt;- sum(pop_targets_2050$total)\n\npop_targets_2030 &lt;- pop_targets_2030 |&gt; \n  mutate(pct_total = total / pop_total_2030)\npop_targets_2050 &lt;- pop_targets_2050 |&gt; \n  mutate(pct_total = total / pop_total_2050)\n\n#writeClipboard(pop_targets_2030)\n# write.table(pop_targets_2030, \"clipboard\", sep=\"\\t\", row.names=FALSE)\n\nWe add economic targets from lmarket, by combining totals from the survey and growth rates by share from the macro file so that shares do not have wild changes (since the shares of lmarket are so different between the macro file and the actual survey).

Initially we had used the default option type = “pctlim” combined with pctlim=0.05, because the method recommends that if reweighting changes for one variable according to its target are not of at least 5%, then it’s not worth burdening the procedure with it. It then ignored sex as a reweighting variable, leaving a small percentage difference between the target and the final population. However, we then tried removing this limitation and the procedure reached convergence in 40 and 49 iterations very efficiently for 2030 and 2050, respectively.\nThis has now been put into a for loop to facilitate multiple scenarios.

In any household survey, family members share the same household weight. Multiplying that weight by the number of household members over all observations adds to the total population of that year. In the persons dataset, the individual’s weight is the household weight divided by the number of family members. But when we do our raking procedure to reweight the dataset to match projected future conditions, we change the individual weights of some family members, but not of others who are not subject to the new conditions. So the family weights need to change to reflect that.

    "text": "Access to water\n“When shocks hit, access to these services is an important determinant of the impact of the shock on welfare. For example, with access to improved drinking water, contaminated water from flooding and storms, or lack of water due to drought has less of an impact. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the current indicator of access to improved drinking water, often represented by covered wells in low-income countries, may not sufficiently reflect susceptibility to contamination during extreme events such as floods or droughts. Therefore, there is a need for future work to refine this indicator by considering a potentially higher threshold. Metrics such as “improved piped water” can offer a more precise assessment of the infrastructure safeguarding against water-related risks in the event of shocks.” (Doan et al. 2023)\nWe take note of this caveat and choose the threshold water supply system installed in the dwelling and water system tap in the yard or vicinity as counting towards this dimension from the possible options below:\n\nThe water supply system installed in the dwelling\nThe water system tap in the yard or vicinity\nThe well in the yard or vicinity\nNatural spring in the yard or vicinity\nRiver, lake, spring, channel\nBought water\nOther\n\n\nvulnerable_water &lt;- poverty |&gt; \n  select(UID, WaterSource) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    vulnerability_water = if_else(\n      WaterSource &lt; 3, 0, 1)) |&gt; \n  select(-WaterSource)\n\n# We check the distribution\n\nas.data.frame(table(vulnerable_water$vulnerability_water)) |&gt; \n  gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVar1\nFreq\n\n\n\n\n0\n10709\n\n\n1\n2499",

Both sanitation and building infrastructure quality, proxied by wall materials could be included in Georgia’s estimates. When it comes to sanitation, there is still a gap that the country needs to close.",
