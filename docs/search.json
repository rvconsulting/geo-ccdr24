    "text": "4 Data preparation income outliers and missings\nWe start with various renames for standardization. Naming conventions in the guidance code use traditional abbreviations like nli for non-lablor income. We are opting for more descriptive variable names like non_labor_income, labor_income, etc. to have more easily readable code. We make an exception for total consumption (tc), because it’s a variable that we use in every scenario and it supersedes lenght limits when adding scenario identifiers.\n\n# Uncomment the correct total expenditure variable below\nex &lt;- hh_expenditure %&gt;% \n  rename(\n    tc =\n      total_expenditure\n      #total_expenditure_aeq06 # Adult equivalent * 0.6\n      #total_expenditure_aeq08 # Adult equivalent * 0.8\n      )\n\n\n4.1 Demographic characteristics, education, labor force\nHere the original code calls for Zone data, which is not present in our dataset, due to the different administrative structure of Georgia. However, we use hh_01_code (settlement) for this purpose. In the end, this variable was never used.\nDemographic data, merge with zone data Note that ed_03 (educy) below is not years of education, but education level (primary, general, secondary, etc.) However, it is ordered in a way that higher levels imply more years of education. We perform several steps within the first pipe call. The variable lstatus (Labor Force Status) here is very important for the reweigthing of the dataset later on. Note that from here onwards we will be creating _microsim versions of our datasets with the transformations needed for calculations. That way we avoid changing our original data and can refer to it later without fearing we’ve left things behind.\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Demographic characteristics\n    # Unique person id\n    person_id = paste0(household_id, \"-\", str_pad(MemberNo, 2, pad = \"0\")),\n    head = ifelse(Relations == 1, 1, 0),\n    # Education level\n    educy = ifelse(is.na(Education), 0, Education),\n    # Labor Force Status\n    lstatus = case_when(\n      # 1.

Inactive (available, not searching)\n      est_10 == 2 ~ 3L,\n      # Out of the labor force\n      .default = 4L # Default to OLF\n    ),\n    employed = (lstatus == 1),\n    # Salaried status (1. paid employee; 2 self-employed)\n    salaried = ifelse(\n      !is.na(emp_11a),\n      1L,\n      ifelse(is.na(emp_11a) &\n               employed == TRUE, 0L, NA_integer_)\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  rename(rel = mem_03, # relationship to HH head\n         gender = mem_02,\n         age = mem_05)\n\nLater, when we conduct the reweighting of the dataset, we need to summarize into three levels of education.\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;%\n  mutate(calif = case_when(\n    educy &gt;= 0 & educy &lt;= 4 ~ \"None - General\",\n    educy &gt; 3 & educy &lt;= 9 ~ \"Secondary - Vocational\",\n    educy &gt; 7 & educy &lt;= 13 ~ \"Higher +\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_  # Values outside the specified ranges\n  ))\n\nCount the number of employed persons by household. Note that it is necessary to explicitly tell R to ignore missing values(NA). This is different from Stata where 1 + .= 1 (where . is “missing”). In R 1 + NA = NA (where NA means “not available”). Not adding na.rm = TRUE to aggregation functions such as sum() in Listing 1 below will not throw an error and only provide a column with NA for households where at least one individidual has an employed status of NA.\n\n\n\n\nListing 1: Employed in household\n\n\n# Pending data from pp_ecstat\nhh_labor &lt;- pp_ecstat %&gt;% \n  mutate(employed = (Status == 1)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(household_id) %&gt;% \n  # Count within each household\n  mutate(employed_hh = sum(employed, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%   \n  ungroup() \n\n\n\n\nHere the original Stata code calculates income variables and aggregates them by household. We skip that because the dataset ic already has these elements calculated by the WB poverty team. We’ll add them later as we need them.\nHowever, as we’ll see later labor income information is heavily non-reported in the dataset. Labor income is a crucial step in merging the dataset with macroeconomic information and so we will predict income for those that do not report it below. These variables are related to labor income, amount and frequency, which we have to standardized to a monthly or yearly value.\nPrimary and Secondary Job income:\n\nemp_11 How much was %rostertitle%’s payment for wages/salary/income for last month?\nemp_12 What period of time was the wage/income for?\nemp_25 How much was %rostertitle%’s payment for wages/salary/income for last month?\nemp_26 What period of time was the wage/income for?\n\nBonus, In-Kind, and food from job was not asked in Georgia, If it were, you should add a mutate() statement like the ones below for each subcategory in Listing 2. We use coalesce(colname, 0) when adding the annual_labor_total again to prevent sums of NA’s. This function replaces a value with 0 within the calculation if it’s missing, but doesn’t change its value permanently.\n\n\n\n\nListing 2: Annualized labor income\n\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;% \n  # Labor income primary job\n  mutate(annual_labor_income_primary = case_when(\n    emp_12 == 1 ~ emp_11 * 365,\n    emp_12 == 2 ~ (emp_11/7) * 365,  # Assuming weekly rate \n    emp_12 == 3 ~ (emp_11/14) * 365,\n    emp_12 == 4 ~ emp_11 * 12,\n    emp_12 == 5 ~ emp_11 * 2,\n    emp_12 == 6 ~ emp_11,\n    emp_12 == 7 ~ NA\n  ))   %&gt;% \n  # Labor income secondary job\n  mutate(annual_labor_income_secondary = case_when(\n    emp_26 == 1 ~ emp_25 * 365,\n    emp_26 == 2 ~ (emp_25/7) * 365,  # Assuming weekly rate \n    emp_26 == 3 ~ (emp_25/14) * 365,\n    emp_26 == 4 ~ emp_25 * 12,\n    emp_26 == 5 ~ emp_25 * 2,\n    emp_26 == 6 ~ emp_25,\n    emp_26 == 7 ~ NA\n  )) %&gt;% \n  # Annual labor total in thousands of dram\n  mutate(annual_labor_total = \n           (coalesce(annual_labor_income_primary, 0) + \n           coalesce(annual_labor_income_secondary, 0))/1000)\n\n# Restore annual_labor_total to NA if both NA\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;% \n  mutate(annual_labor_total =\n           if_else(\n             is.na(annual_labor_income_primary)\n             & is.na(annual_labor_income_secondary),\n         NA, \n         annual_labor_total))\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to check the share of individuals that are employed, but did not report income. This is done in Listing 3 below.\n\n\n\n\nListing 3: Employed with no income reported\n\n\ntotal_employed_no_income &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;%\n  filter(employed == TRUE & is.na(annual_labor_total)) %&gt;% \n  nrow()\n\ntotal_employed &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;%\n  filter(employed == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  nrow()\n\npercent_employed_no_income &lt;- \n  (total_employed_no_income / total_employed) * 100\n\nprint(\n  paste0(\n    \"There is \",\n    format(\n      percent_employed_no_income,digits = 2, nsmall=2\n      ),\n    \"% of the employed population that reports no income.\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nWe also need to mark income outliers as those with incomes outside 5 standard deviations.\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim  %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    # Calculate standard deviation\n    sd = sd(annual_labor_total, na.rm = TRUE), \n    d = annual_labor_total / sd,                \n    # Combined outlier condition\n    outlier = (d &gt; 5) | (employed == TRUE & annual_labor_total == 0), \n    # Mark potential missings\n    missings = if_else(employed == TRUE, is.na(annual_labor_total), NA) \n  ) \n\nEconomic sector. The economic sectors dataset contains a lookup table for sector aggregation which we add to the pp_microsim database in Listing 4.\n\n\n\n\nListing 4: Sector aggregation\n\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;%\n  mutate(emp_04 = as.integer(emp_04)) %&gt;% \n  left_join(sectors, join_by(\"emp_04\" == \"economic_activity_code\") ) %&gt;% \n  rename(sector = ea_shortcode)\n\n\n\n\nSome individuals report no sector for either their primary or secondary job. In Listing 5 we find out the sector of other family members in their home and assign the sector of whoever is closest using fill( other_sector, .direction = \"downup\").\n\n\n\n\nListing 5: Assign sector to those who don’t report one\n\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;%\n  group_by(household_id) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Create a temporary variable 'other_sector'\n    # which captures the sector of any employed \n    # individual in the household\n    other_sector = \n      if_else(employed == TRUE & !is.na(sector), sector, NA_real_)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Use 'fill' to propagate 'other_sector' values within the household\n  fill(other_sector, .direction = \"downup\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Impute missing 'sector' values based on the 'other_sector'\n    sector = \n      if_else(is.na(sector) & employed == TRUE, other_sector, sector)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Drop the temporary 'other_sector' variable\n  select(-other_sector) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nWe then assign a specific value for missing sectors for those employed with no one else in the hh to assign value. We select services as it’s the heaviest sector in the dataset (we do it like this, instead of say, any matching technique, because it’s only 2 observations).\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;%\n  mutate(sector = if_else(is.na(sector) & employed == TRUE, 3, sector))\n\nWe provide value labels for sector factors.\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;%\n  mutate(sector_name = factor(sector, levels = c(1, 2, 3),\n                         labels = c(\"Agriculture\", \n                                    \"Manufacturing\", \n                                    \"Services\")))\n\nWe make sure that those outside the labor force (OLF) do not report a sector, which we replace with NA for those who meet the condition.\n\n\n\n\nListing 6: No sector for OLF\n\n\npp_microsim &lt;- pp_microsim %&gt;%\n  mutate(lstatus = as.numeric(lstatus),\n         sector = \n           if_else(lstatus == 4, \n                   as.character(NA), \n                   as.character(sector)),\n         industry = as.factor(sector)) %&gt;%\n  # We need this for reweighting and \n  # not messing up the regression below.\n  mutate(sector_w = sector)",
