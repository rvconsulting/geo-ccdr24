It is part of a larger project with all background contributions to Georgia’s CCDR, available in this repository.\nUsing RStudio project makes it possible to not use setwd() to establish the root directory and refer to subdirectories in a relative manner, making interoperability easier within teams and not hard coding a particular computer’s file structure into the code. If you are using Positron or Visual Studio Code (and the Quarto extension) just “open folder” at the root of the repository. If you are using R directly, just add setwd(r'(C:\\My\\path\\to\\project\\root)') at the beginning of your coding session.\n\n\nWe start with a clean environment, making sure that any objects from a previous session are not present. We keep our country ISO code in a variable iso in case we need it later.\n\n# Clean workspace\nrm(list = ls())\n\n# Georgia country ISO code\niso &lt;- \"GEO\"\n\n# Survey year\nsurvey_year &lt;- 2023\n\n# Exchange rate USD per GEL\ner &lt;- 0.37\n\n# Years of interest for our macroeconomic scenario analysis\nanalysis_years &lt;- c(2030, 2050)\n\nWe call the appropriate libraries.\nRather than calling our libraries as we go, we will make sure we have everything we need from the beginning.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # includes dplyr, ggplot2, purr...\nlibrary(haven)     # to read SPSS and Stata datasets\nlibrary(readxl)    # to read from MS-Excel\nlibrary(openxlsx)  # to write to MS-Excel.\nlibrary(gt)        # pretty tables\nlibrary(car)       # companion to applied regression\nlibrary(modelr)    # regression models\n#library(anesrake)  \n# Raking reweighting but we don't load it, because \n# it changes the meaning of summarize from dplyr, \n# so we use the form anesrake::anesrake() when using it.\nlibrary(janitor)   # pretty subtotals\nlibrary(broom)     # More regressions\nlibrary(zoo)       # Calculate moving window average and max value\n# library(ineq) # Inequality measures\n# library(acid)\n\n# Geopackages\nlibrary(sf)        # to read and write shapefile maps\nlibrary(terra)     # to perform geocalculations\nlibrary(tmap)      # for static and interactive maps\n\n\n\n\nWe then load the datasets that we need for this study.

We will estimate annual_labor_total after predictions.\nLooking at the data we see that only those that report being an employee or “other” report having labor income 1 or 2; Employer and Own Account non-ag report having surplus; and own account ag and (of course) unpaid worker\nWe first identify who needs predictions for job1, job2, and surplus. We default to NA because we want to preserve the logic of those who don’t have an income, because they aren’t supposed to have one. However, this introduces an uncertainty element when predicting further down the line, because subsetting does not allow NA’s. Even if we want to match just TRUEs. So it’s a double-edged sword.

    "text": "2.5 The income simulation regression\nSince labor income was a key variable, which we needed to match with the future wage bill by economic activity, we first checked for missing values among employed individuals. We found that almost a third of respondents (28.6%) did not report income for either their primary or secondary job. To overcome this limitation, we used the available information from the remaining respondents to estimate an extended Mincer equation, as shown in Equation 1, and implemented in Listing 1. For the respondents with available information, we also identified outliers as those outside of five standard deviations from the mean labor income.\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\ln(lab_i) = \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{age}_i + \\\\\n\\beta_2 \\text{gender}_i + \\beta_3 \\text{education}_i + \\\\\n\\beta_4 \\text{age}^2_i + \\beta_5 \\text{marz}_i + \\\\\n\\beta_6 \\text{sector}_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\ln(lab_i)\\) is the natural logarithm of labor income for individual \\(i\\).\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept term.\n\\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\beta_5, \\beta_6\\) are the coefficients for the respective independent variables.\n\\(\\text{age}_i\\) is the age of individual \\(i\\).\n\\(\\text{gender}_i\\) is a binary variable indicating the gender of individual \\(i\\) (1 for female, 2 for male).\n\\(\\text{education}_i\\) represents the level of education for individual \\(i\\) (ordered: 1) None to General, 2) Secondary to Vocational, 3) Higher education).\n\\(\\text{age}^2_i\\) is the square of the age of individual \\(i\\), included to capture non-linear effects of age on labor income.\n\\(\\text{marz}_i\\) represents the region where individual \\(i\\) resides.\n\\(\\text{sector}_i\\) represents the sector of employment for individual \\(i\\) (i.e., agriculture, manufacturing or services).\n\\(\\epsilon_i\\) is the error term for individual \\(i\\).\n\nWe first prepare our variables for the regression.\n\npp_microsim06 &lt;- pp_microsim05 |&gt;\n  rename(\n    education = Education,\n    age = Age,\n    gender = Gender,\n    region = RegNo) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    education2 = education^2,\n    age2 = age^2,\n    male = case_when(\n      gender == 1 ~ 1,\n      gender == 2 ~ 0\n    ),\n    ln_lab1 = if_else(\n      !is.na(labor_income_job1) & labor_income_job1 != 0,\n      log(labor_income_job1),\n      NA),\n    ln_lab2 = if_else(\n      !is.na(labor_income_job2) & labor_income_job2 != 0,\n      log(labor_income_job2),\n      NA),\n    ln_surplus = if_else(\n      !is.na(surplus_income) & surplus_income != 0,\n      log(surplus_income),\n      NA),\n    sim_job1 = NA_real_,\n    sim_job2 = NA_real_,\n    sim_surplus = NA_real_\n  )|&gt;\n  # Labor Market Status \n  mutate(\n    lmarket = case_when(\n      !is.na(Q7) ~ as.numeric(SAM3_job1),\n      is.na(Q7) & age &gt;= 15 ~ 4, # Unemployed\n      is.na(Q7) & age &lt; 15 ~ 5,  # OLF\n      .default = NA_integer_\n  )\n)\n\nFilter the data for regression conditions.\n\nregression_data_job1 &lt;- pp_microsim06 |&gt;\n  filter(Q7 %in% c(1,6) & fix_job1 == F)\n\nregression_data_job2 &lt;- pp_microsim06 |&gt; \n  filter(Q13 %in% c(1,6) & fix_job2 == F)\n\nregression_data_surplus &lt;- pp_microsim06 |&gt; \n  filter(Q7 %in% c(2,3) & fix_surplus == F)\n\nRegression model.\n\n\n\n\nListing 1: Income regression model\n\n\nmodel_job1 &lt;- lm(\n  ln_lab1 ~ \n    age + gender + education + \n    age2 + region + SAM3_job1,\n    data = regression_data_job1)\n\nmodel_job2 &lt;- lm(\n  ln_lab2 ~ \n    age + gender + education + \n    age2 + region + SAM3_job2,\n    data = regression_data_job2)\n\nmodel_surplus &lt;- lm(\n  ln_surplus ~ \n    age + gender + education + \n    age2 + region + SAM3_job1,\n    data = regression_data_surplus)\n\n\n\n\nApplying predictions to those who need it.\nNote: The ‘predict’ function in R does not directly support conditions within the function call, so we handle this by filtering or subsetting the data as needed.\nNote: ‘type = “response”’ might be needed depending on model type.\n\n# rows to predict (this removes uncertainty NAs for predictions)\ntarget_rows_job1    &lt;- which(pp_microsim06$fix_job1    == TRUE)\ntarget_rows_job2    &lt;- which(pp_microsim06$fix_job2    == TRUE)\ntarget_rows_surplus &lt;- which(pp_microsim06$fix_surplus == TRUE)\n\n# predictions\npp_microsim06$sim_job1[target_rows_job1] &lt;- exp(\n  predict(\n    model_job1, \n    pp_microsim06[target_rows_job1, ], \n    type = \"response\")\n)\n\npp_microsim06$sim_job2[target_rows_job2] &lt;- exp(\n  predict(\n    model_job1, \n    pp_microsim06[target_rows_job2, ], \n    type = \"response\")\n)\n\npp_microsim06$sim_surplus[target_rows_surplus] &lt;- exp(\n  predict(\n    model_job1, \n    pp_microsim06[target_rows_surplus, ], \n    type = \"response\")\n)\n\nAt this point, if there were negative predictions, we would have to make them zero.

Initially we had used the default option type = “pctlim” combined with pctlim=0.05, because the method recommends that if reweighting changes for one variable according to its target are not of at least 5%, then it’s not worth burdening the procedure with it. It then ignored sex as a reweighting variable, leaving a small percentage difference between the target and the final population. However, we then tried removing this limitation and the procedure reached convergence in 40 and 49 iterations very efficiently for 2030 and 2050, respectively.\n\n# Since this uses base R, we need to

Therefore, there is a need for future work to refine this indicator by considering a potentially higher threshold.
